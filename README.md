# Dracula-Powershell-ISE
My attempt at making a Dracula format for the Powershell ISE.

# How to Install
Download the Dracula ISE V3.StorableColorTheme.ps1xml from this repository
Save it somewhere
In the Powershell ISE go to "Tools"
Select "Manage Themes"
Go to where you saved the file and select the Dracula ISE V3.StorableColorTheme.ps1xml
Apply the changes
